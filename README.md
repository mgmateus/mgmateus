### UAV - Autonomous Land

The current work proposes an approach to the development of this system, aiming to recognize a target on the water's surface and subsequently navigate towards it to perform UAVs emergency landings. The application of this approach is motivated by the use of photorealistic environments to enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning.

This approach involves the characterization of active perception, focusing particularly on visual perception. For this purpose, the agent's observations are generated by interpreting visual processing, without the need to use convolutional neural networks or contrastive learning. The obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the agent's learned policy during the conducted tests, enabling successful landings on targets positioned in various locations and orientations within the agent's field of view.
